# OpenTTD-Israeli-Town-Names

Adds Israeli town name generator to OpenTTD.

In order to compile, just run

    nmlc.exe israel.nml
  
Note: nmlc version 0.5.3 has a bug (https://github.com/OpenTTD/nml/issues/229) which cause the compilation to fail.
The bug has been fixed in master. Until a new release will be made, I compiled with an older version, before the bug was
introduced - 0.4.5.
